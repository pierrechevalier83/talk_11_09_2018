## The quest for consensus
### The Byzantine Generals Problem
.fitted-pic[![byzantine](assets/images/byzantine_army.jpg)]
???
In 1982, Leslie Lamport et all described the following mathematical problem:

A group of generals of the byzantine army are camped with their troops around an ennemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors trying to confuse the others.

The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.

This problem seems deceptively simple, but it has been extensively studied in the last 20 years and better and better solutions keep coming up.

count: false

- Asynchronous

Simplicity is a property that is extremely underrated.
If an algorithm is simple, it improves the security of the implementation
as anyone can reason about it and see bugs.

So we came to realize that the state of the art wasn't enough and that we would need to come up with our own solution if we wanted a protocol to fit all our needs.

## PARSEC
### Features
.fitted-pic[![PARSEC](assets/images/spoiler_alert.png)]

???
Now, how you solve a complex maths problem is by breaking it down into simpler maths problems and solving these.

Even better if someone else already solved these smaller maths problems for you so you can save some time.

In this section, I'll explain some of these smaller maths problems for the case of consensus.

It's gonna be really boring, so I thought I would reveal the features we gain from this exercise so hopefully that keeps you motivated to listen to my monotone lecture :)

template:sparks
count: false
## PARSEC
### Features
???
So with PARSEC, we achieved to find a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem that is:
--
count: false

* Asynchronous ✓ (*)
???
Almost asynchronous:
- Every step of the algorithm is fully asynchronous with one exception: the concrete coin
- In that step, we can't claim we are fully asynchronous as we don't meet the technical theoretical requirements; although in practice, it's very unlikely to make a difference
- The synchrony assumption we have is still less than that of any competing protocol that scales like ours does
- We are currently focused on implementing the algorithm we already have as this is necessary to get the SAFE Network off the ground; but we think we may be able to make that last step fully asynchronous with no asterisque with a little bit more research
--
count: false

* Scalable ✓
???
No compromise: PARSEC can reach consensus in O(N*log(N)) which is at the theoretical limit for the number of nodes.
---
template:sparks
count: false
## PARSEC
### Features

* Asynchronous ✓ (*)

* Scalable ✓

* Permission-less ✓
???
The algorithm can operate in a completely permission-less setting.
The only requirement is that less than a third of the participants at any time are malicious, which we guarentee in the SAFE Network with a number of Sybil protection measures such as node ageing.
Nodes can join a section and leave it without affecting consensus and without requiring any syncrhonous step.
--
count: false

* Open Source ✓
???
Not only in license, GPL-V3 which is Free software, but also in our ethos.
We have already received 2 contributions to the PARSEC github and feedback on the whitepaper from members of the forum and even from Vlad Zamfir from Ethereum.
--
count: false

* Simple ✓
???
In the litterature, you find all kinds of fancy algorithms to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem or parts of it; and most of them aren't even efficient.
Our algorithm only uses simple ideas and composes them to make an elegant solution.

Not to make it sound like we're some kinds of geniuses: the two most powerful, simple and elegant ideas behind PARSEC are the way we solve binary consensus and the concrete coin idea. Both ideas were shameless-ly ripped off from existing papers :D
---
template:sparks_2
## PARSEC
### In a nutshell

--
count: false
.center.fitted-pic[![PARSEC overview](assets/images/parsec_overview.png)]
???
- We call a group that contains over two thirds of the nodes a supermajority
- Nodes constantly **gossip** to each other
- They record information gossiped to them as **gossip events** inside a **gossip graph**
- **gossip events** in a gossip graph may have special relationships such as **seeing** each other or **strongly seeing** each other
- When a node notices that something happens in the network, they **vote** to inform other nodes of their observation
- The vote is conveyed to other nodes through **gossip**
- **gossip events** that contain votes and have been **strongly seen** by a **supermajority** of nodes are **interesting events**.
- They are said to carry **valid blocks**
